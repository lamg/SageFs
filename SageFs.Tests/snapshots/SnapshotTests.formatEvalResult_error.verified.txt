Error: Operation could not be completed due to earlier error
⚠️ This 'earlier error' means a PREVIOUS statement had a compile error, so its definitions were never created. The session is NOT corrupted — all successfully evaluated statements are still valid. Fix the original error and re-submit that code, then retry. Do NOT reset the session.
