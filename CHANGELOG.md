## [0.5.19] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- MCP push notifications via McpServerTracker + EventAccumulator + CallToolFilter — agents no longer need to poll

### Performance
- Benchmarked hot paths in FSI: CellGrid, cleanStdout, TUI emit, JSON serialize, sprintf cache keys
- Identified 8× total frame speedup opportunity; implementation starting this release

## [0.5.17] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- MCP session routing now prioritizes `working_directory` over cached agent session, fixing multi-project workflows where all commands routed to the first session
- Replaced named pipe transport with HTTP (Kestrel) transport, eliminating hangs when `get_fsi_status` was called during long-running evaluations

### Changed
- Worker processes now communicate over HTTP instead of named pipes
- Each worker starts a Kestrel server on an OS-assigned port, enabling concurrent request handling

### Added
- Initial public release as a .NET global tool
- F# REPL with FSI session management
- MCP server for AI assistant integration
